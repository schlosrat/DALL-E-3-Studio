DALL-E 3 Image Studio
A lightweight Python-based desktop application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for generating images using OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model. This tool allows users to customize image quality, aspect ratio, manage session history, and save high-resolution images locally.

Features
Customizable Generation: Toggle between Standard and HD quality.

Multiple Aspect Ratios: Support for Square (1:1), Portrait (9:16), and Landscape (16:9).

Session History: Automatically tracks prompts and images generated during the current session.

Local Saving: Save high-resolution PNG files directly to your computer.

Real-time Feedback: Includes an indeterminate progress bar and status updates during the generation process.

Prerequisites
1. Install Python
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

Windows/macOS: Download from python.org.

Linux: Use your package manager (e.g., sudo apt install python3).

2. OpenAI API Key
You will need a valid API key from OpenAI. Ensure your account has a positive credit balance to avoid "billing limit" errors.

Setup Instructions
1. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Windows:

Bash

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Linux / macOS:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries using pip:

Bash

pip install openai pillow requests
Running the Application
Execute the code from your command prompt:

Windows:

Bash

python main.py
Linux / macOS:

Bash

python3 main.py
Using the Interface
The GUI is divided into two main sections: Generation Controls (Left) and Session History (Right).

Generation Controls
API Key: Enter your OpenAI Secret Key here. Characters are masked for security.

Size Pane: Choose between Standard (faster/cheaper) and HD (higher detail).

Aspect Ratio Pane: Select your desired output format (Square, Portrait, or Landscape).

Prompt: Enter a detailed description of the image you want to create.

Generate: Click to start. The Progress Bar will indicate active generation.

Save Current: Saves the currently displayed image as a PNG file.

Session History
History List: Every successful generation is added here. Clicking an entry reloads that image and its original prompt.

Clear History: Permanently removes all entries from the current session.
